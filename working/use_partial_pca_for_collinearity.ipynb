    "This notebook introduces a way to use partial Principal Component Analysis to address the collinearity issue in the data. I first classify the variables into small groups which similar features, for example, church_count, build_count, cafe_price and etc. Then apply a PCA for each group of variables and use a stop criteria of 0.95 of total variance to pick the number of principal component. Finally, I assemble the data and draw the correlation plots to compare before and after transformation of the original data."
